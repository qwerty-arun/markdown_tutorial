|Linux Commands|What does it do? |
|:-------:|:-------|
|pwd|This command is used to find out the path of the current directory(folder).This command will return an absolute path, which is a path of all directories that starts with a forward slash(/).An example of an absolute path is:-  /home/username .|
|cd|This command is used to navigate through linux files and directories.  It either requires a full path or name of the directory depending on the current directory you are in.Let’s say you’re in /home/username/Documents and you want to go to Photos, a subdirectory of Documents. To do so, simply type the following command: cd Photos.Now if you want to switch to a completely new directory, say /home/username/Books. In this case, you have to type cd followed by the directory’s absolute path: cd /home/username/Books.Some shortcuts:- -> cd.. (with two dots) to move one directory up.-> cd to go straight to the home folder.-> cd- (with hypen) to move to your previous directory. NOTE:- You have to type the directories' names exactly as it is becouse Linux's shell is case sensitive.|
|ls|This command is used to list contents os a directory. By default, this will display content of your current working directory. If you want to view contents of other directories, type ls and then the directory's path.For example:- /homes/username/Movies to view contents of MoviesVariations in this command:-- ls -R will list all the files in teh sub-directories as well.- ls -a will show all the hidden files.- ls al will list the files and directories with detailed information like owner, size etc.|
|cat|The cat command is a multi-purpose utility in the Linux system. It can be used to create a file, display content of the file, copy the content of one file to another file, and more.This command is the most frequently used command in linux.To run this command, type cat followed by the file's name and its extension. For Example:- cat file.txtOther ways to use cat command:-- cat > filename creates a new file.- cat filename1 filename2>filename3 joins two files (1 and 2) and stores the output of them in a new file (3). - to convert a file to upper or lower case use, cat filename tr a-z A-Z >output.txt|
|cp|This command is used copy files from your current directory to a different directory. For example:- the command cp blackhole.jpg /home/username/Pictures would create a copy of blackhole.jpg (from your current directory) into the Pictures directory.|
|mv|The primary use of this command is to move files, although it can be used to rename files.For example:- mv neutronstar.txt /home/username/Universe. To rename files, mv oldname.txt newname.txt|
|mkdir|Is used to make a new directory. mkdir Music will create directory called Music.Other uses:- - to create a directory inside an other directory: mkdir Music/newfile- use the p (parents) option to create a directory in between two existing directories. For example, mkdir -p Music/Charlie/Newfile will create the new “Charlie” file.|
|rmdir|This command is used to delete a directory. However rmdir only allows you to delete empty directories.Syntax: rmdir <directory name>| 
|rm|This command is used to delete directories and its contents within them. Use rm -r (as an alternative to rmdir) to delete a directory.Caution:- Always be sure which directory you are in as this command will delete everything and there is no going back.|
|touch|Used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file.|
|locate|This command locates a file. Using -i along with this command makes it case-insensitive, therefore you can search for a file even if you don't know its exact name.Use an asterik(*) to search for a file which contains two or more names. For example:- locate -i maths*notes command will search for any file that contains the words "maths" and "notes".|
|find|Similar to **locate** command, find also searches for files and directories. But it finds command within a given directory. For example:- find /home/ -name notes.txt command will search for a file called notes.txt within the home directory and its sub-directories.To find files in current directory use, find. -name notes.txt and to look for directories use, / -type d -name notes. txt |
