# What is an Operating System? 
Its the most important software that runs on computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the OS that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change OSs. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

# Operating System's Job
It manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your ocmputer's ***central processing unit(CPU), memory and storage***. The OS coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.

# Types of Operating Systems
The three most common operating systems are for personal computers are ***Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux***. Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use your mosue to click icons, buttons and menus and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.

Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, most of the basic principles are same and they are also *easy to use*.

## Microsoft Windows
Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been different versions of windows, but the most recent one is Windows 11(released in 2021). Windows com pre-loaded in most new PCs. Windows is the most popular operating system in the world. Windows is a close-source operating system, meaning its software is not available for free and can only be modified by the company.

## macOS 
Apple created the macOS. It comes pre-loaded on all Macintosh computers(macs). Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016). macOS users account for less than 10% of the total global operating systems. Windows users account for more than 80%. One reason for this is because apple computers are expensive. macOS is a close-source operating system.

## Linux 
Linux is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. ***This is different from proprietary software like Windows and macOS, which can only be modified by the company that owns it***. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from.
