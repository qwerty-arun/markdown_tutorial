## Image file formats can be broadly classified into two forms:-
1) Raster images 
2) Vector images

### Raster file formats
Raster images are constructed by a series of ***pixels*** (where each pixel is assigned a color), to form an image. Basically, every photo you find online or which are in print is a raster image. `JPEG, JPG and PNG` are raster image extensions. 
Pixels have a defined proportion based on their resolution(high or low), and when the pixels are strecthed to fill space they were not originally intended to fit in, they become distorted, resulting in blurry or unclear images. In order to  retain pixel quality, you cannot resize raster images without compromising their resolution. As a result, it is important to remember to save raster files at the exact dimensions needed for the application. 
`JPEG, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, RAW, PSD`.

### Vector file formats
Vector images are digital artwork in which points, lines and curves are calculated by the computer. Unlike raster images, vector images are resolution independent. When you shrink or enlarge a vector image, your shapes get larger, but you won’t lose any detail or get any pixelation. Because your image will always render identically, no matter the size, there is no such thing as a lossy or lossless vector image type. Vector images are typically used for logos, icons, typesetting and digital illustrations. `EPS, AI, SVG and PDF` are perfect for creating graphics that require frequent resizing. Your logo and brand graphics should have been created as a vector, and you should always have a master file on hand. The real beauty of vectors lies in their ability to be sized as small as a postage stamp, or even to fit on very large enough objects. `PDF, EPS, AI, SVG`.

### CMYK v/s RGB
These are image color formats. All raster images can be saved in of these primary color models.   
CMYK is a four color printing process which stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and key(black). These colors represent the four inks that will combine during the printing process. Files saved in this format will be optimized for physical printing.   
RGB stands for red, green and blue. These are the three primary colors of light that combine to produce other colors. Files saved in this format will be optimized for the web, mobile phones, film and video—anything that appears on a screen.

|`IMAGE FILES`|`FULL FORM`| `DESCRIPTION`|
|:----------------------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|JPEG/JPG| Joint Photographic Experts Group| JPEG and JPG are the same thing. This is one of the most used formats online, for photos, web images for banner ads. <br> JPEGs are known for their "lossy" compression, meaning that the quality of the image decreases as the file size decreases.|
|PNG| Portable Networks Graphics| PNGs are "lossless," meaning you can edit them and not lose quality, they are still low resolution. This format has built-in transparency, but can also display higher color depths, which translates into millions of colors. PNG's are a web standard and are quickly becoming one of the most common image formats online.|
|GIF| Graphics interchange format|GIF is also a widely used web image format, typically for animated graphics like banner ads, email images and social media memes. Though GIFs are "lossless" , they can be exported in a number of highly customizable settings that reduce the amount of colors and image information, which in turn reduces the file size. <br> In their more basic form, GIFs are formed from up to 256 colors in the RGB colorspace. Due to the limited number of colors, the file size is drastically reduced. This is a common file type for web projects where an image needs to load very quickly, as opposed to one that needs to retain a higher level of quality. |
|TIFF/TIF|Tagged Image File Format|TIFF is a lossless raster format that stands for Tagged Image File Format. Because of its extremely high quality, the format is primarily used in photography and desktop publishing. You’ll likely encounter TIFF files when you scan a document or take a photo with a professional digital camera. One should avoid using this type of file format on the web, since it can take forever to load, it can seriously affect the performance of the website.|
|PSD| Photoshop Document|PSDs are files that are created and saved in Adobe Photoshop.  This type of file contains "layers" that make modifying the image much easier to handle. PSDs are primarily used to create and edit raster images, but this unique format can also contain vector layers as well, making it extremely flexible for a number of different projects. A PSD can be exported into any number of image file formats, including all of the raster formats listed above.|
|RAW|Raw images|RAW files contain uncompressed and unprocessed image data, allowing photographers to capture practically every detail they see in their viewfinder. The RAW file format stores the largest amount of detail out of any raster file type, which photographers can then edit, compress and convert into other formats.|
|PDF| Portable Document format| PDFs were invented by Adobe. PDF files have a powerful vector graphics foundation, but can also display everything from raster graphics to form fields to spreadsheets.|
|EPS|Encapsulated PostScript|Although it is used primarily as a vector format, an EPS file can include both vector and raster image data. EPS files are designed to produce high-resolution graphics for print.|
|AI| Adobe Illustator|AI files are primarily a vector-based format, though they can also include embedded or linked raster images. AI files can be exported to both PDF and EPS files (for easy reviewing and printing), and also JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF and PSD (for web use and further editing).|
|SVG|Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG is an XML based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. It can be searched, indexed, scaled and compressed and can result in smaller file sizes than other file formats, which makes it ideal for web. SVG files can be edited in graphic editing programs as well as text editors.|
