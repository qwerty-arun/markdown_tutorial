## Image file formats can be broadly classified into two forms:-
1) Raster images 
2) Vector images

### Raster file formats
Raster images are constructed by a series of ***pixels***, or individual blocks, to form an image. Basically, every photo you find online or which are in print is a raster image. JPEG, JPG and PNG, all are raster image extensions. 
Pixels have a defined proportion based on their resolution(high or low), and when the pixels are strecthed to fill space they were not originally intended to fit in, they become distorted, resulting in blurry or unclear images.
