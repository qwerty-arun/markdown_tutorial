## Image file formats can be broadly classified into two forms:-
1) Raster images 
2) Vector images

### Raster file formats
Raster images are constructed by a series of ***pixels***, or individual blocks, to form an image. Basically, every photo you find online or which are in print is a raster image. `JPEG, JPG and PNG` are raster image extensions. 
Pixels have a defined proportion based on their resolution(high or low), and when the pixels are strecthed to fill space they were not originally intended to fit in, they become distorted, resulting in blurry or unclear images. In order to  retain pixel quality, you cannot resize raster images without compromising their resolution. As a result, it is important to remember to save raster files at the exact dimensions needed for the application. 
`JPEG, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, RAW, PSD`.

### Vector file formats
They are constructed using proportional formulas rather than pixels. `EPS, AI, SVG and PDF` are perfect for creating graphics that require frequent resizing. Your logo and brand graphics should have been created as a vector, and you should always have a master file on hand. The real beauty of vectors lies in their ability to be sized as small as a postage stamp, or even to fit on very large enough objects. `PDF, EPS, AI, SVG`.

### CMYK v/s RGB
These are image color formats. All raster images can be saved in of these primary color models.   
CMYK is a four color printing process which stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and key(black). These colors represent the four inks that will combine during the printing process. Files saved in this format will be optimized for physical printing.   
RGB stands for red, green and blue. These are the three primary colors of light that combine to produce other colors. Files saved in this format will be optimized for the web, mobile phones, film and videoâ€”anything that appears on a screen.
