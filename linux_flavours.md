Depending on the user's needs, there are many different flavours of linux one can use. Generally, there are three different categories of linux flavours with their own particular uses: <ins>Security-focuses, User-focused and Unique</ins>.

## Security-focused

If you are using a system that is not secure enough, anyone can access your system and exploit your data, such as photos, videos, files, and sensitive financial information. Several different kinds of secure Linux distros exist, and each is developed for unique usages, including spy-level security, personal use, organizational usage, and more. Distros from the Security-Focused category are best used in situations where there is an elevated need for security-related features. These users range from businesses and enterprises that have heightened security needs to personal users who are security-conscious. Examples:- Kali Linux, Qubes OS, Parrot Security OS, Linux Kodachi etc.


## User-focused 

As the name suggests, these distros are more user-friendly. These Linux distros require a lower level of Linux skill and tend to be implemented more for ease and simplicity than for their security features. Examples: Ubuntu, Elementary OS, Linux Mint etc.

## Unique 
Unique Linux distros are those that have a certain specific use which is either specially-focused or novelty. Examples: Hannah Montana Linux.


|Linux Flavours|It's picture and description|
|:-------:|:------:|
|Qubes OS|![](https://distroratings.github.io/images/qubes_os.png) </br> Qubes OS is the top security-focused Linux based OS system around today. The magic behind Qubes OS’s security prowess lies in the fact that it isolates your files and VMs. This translates into greater protection from malware attacks when they occur.If malware finds its way onto your Qubes OS system, your personal files will be isolated from damage. Keep in mind that with this increased security comes an advanced level of difficulty of system management, so this distro is not the best for beginner and intermediate users.|
