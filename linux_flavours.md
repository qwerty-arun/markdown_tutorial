Depending on the user's needs, there are many different flavours of linux one can use. Generally, there are three different categories of linux flavours with their own particular uses: <ins>Security-focuses, User-focused and Unique</ins>.

## Security-focused

If you are using a system that is not secure enough, anyone can access your system and exploit your data, such as photos, videos, files, and sensitive financial information. Several different kinds of secure Linux distros exist, and each is developed for unique usages, including spy-level security, personal use, organizational usage, and more. Distros from the Security-Focused category are best used in situations where there is an elevated need for security-related features. These users range from businesses and enterprises that have heightened security needs to personal users who are security-conscious. Examples:- Kali Linux, Qubes OS, Parrot Security OS, Linux Kodachi etc.


## User-focused 

As the name suggests, these distros are more user-friendly. These Linux distros require a lower level of Linux skill and tend to be implemented more for ease and simplicity than for their security features.

## Unique
