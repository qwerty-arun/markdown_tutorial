# What is an open source license?
*An open-source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified and/or shared under defined terms and conditions. This allows end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code, blueprint or design for their own customization, curiosity or troubleshooting needs. Open-source licensed software is mostly available free of charge, though this does not necessarily have to be the case.* 

Basically, these licenses serve as a legal agreement between the open source author and the user. Authors make Open Source Software(OOS) for free, but with certain requirements that the user must follow.If you use an open source component, you are legally responsible for complying with the terms of its license. If you author a piece of open source software, selecting the wrong license may allow companies to leverage your project in ways you don't approve of.


# Types of Open Source Licenses:
There are two main types of open source licenses, ***permissive*** and ***copyleft***. Permissive licenses have fewer restricitons than copyleft licenses.

## Permissive Licenses: 
Users can take the permissive-licensed software, make it their own through changes or additions, and distribute that modified program with only a handful of conditions.
### Most popular Permissive Licenses:- 
1. MIT LIcenses:-
   It is the most commonly used and permissive open source licenses. Under this license, you can essentially do anything with the software as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in the copy of the software. It is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, including the GPLs. 
2. Apache License 2.0:- 
   The Apache License 2.0 is another commonly used permissive open source license. With this license, you have the freedom to do what you want with the software, with the exception that you must include the original copyright and license notice, state any significant changes, and include the NOTICE file if there is one. It's also important to note that while the Apache License 2.0 is compatible with GPL v3, it is not compatible with GPL v2.
3. BSD License:- 
   The BSD License, short for Berkeley Software Distribution, allows the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software as long as the copyright notice and license text are included in the copy of the software. There are several different variants of this license. BSD 3-Clause License is the most popular varient.
   
## Copyleft Licenses: 
 copyleft licenses generally require that any derivative work of the copyleft-licensed software be released under the same license as the original. In other words, the modified code has to be exactly as “open” as the original. Copyleft Licenses come in two flavours: strong copyleft and weak copyleft. 
Strong copyleft licenses require anyone who distributes derivative works of the licensed code to make available the corresponding source code under that same license. Strong copyleft licenses apply to the entire software program, including linked libraries and other components. GPL v2, and GPL v3, and AGPL are examples of strong copyleft licenses.
Weak copyleft licenses (like the LGPL License and Mozilla Public License 2.0) have similar requirements, but they apply to a narrower set of code. If a user modifies and distributes code covered by a weak copyleft license, they would need to release the modified version under the same license as the original.
### Most popular Copyleft Licenses:-
1. GPL License:- 
   The GPL(General Public License) License states that if you write and distribute a program using a GPL-licensed component, you must also release the full source code while giving your users the same rights you received. This license was created to protect software from becoming proprietary, or private, which is why many programmers like this license. Most commonly used licenses:- GPL v2 and GPL v3.
2. Mozilla Public License:- 
   MPL 2.0 is a weak copyleft license maintained by Mozilla Foundation. If a distributed program modifies code licensed under MPL 2.0, those modifications must also be licensed under MPL 2.0 and made available in source code form
